# Message Notifications Fix

## Problem Description
When sending new messages in the chat, notifications are not being triggered automatically. This happens because the notification system is set up but not connected to the message creation process.

## Root Cause
The current system lacks automatic notification triggers when new messages are inserted into the `messages` table. The notification service exists but is only called manually, not automatically.

## Solutions Implemented

### Solution 1: Client-Side Notifications (Implemented)
‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Updated `src/services/realtimeChat.ts` to automatically send notifications when messages are sent.

**What it does:**
- Automatically sends notifications when `sendMessage()` is called
- Creates notification records in the `notification_history` table
- Calls the push notification edge function
- Handles different message types (text, photo, voice, GIF, sticker)
- Respects user notification preferences

**Files modified:**
- `src/services/realtimeChat.ts` - Added `sendMessageNotification()` method

### Solution 2: Database Triggers (Alternative)
Created `sql/message-notification-trigger-simple.sql` for database-level notification triggers.

**What it does:**
- Automatically creates notification records when messages are inserted
- Works regardless of client state
- More reliable but requires database changes

## How to Test the Fix

### 1. Test Client-Side Notifications (Immediate)
1. Send a new message in any conversation
2. Check the browser console for notification logs
3. Verify that a notification record is created in `notification_history` table
4. Check if the recipient receives a push notification

### 2. Test Database Triggers (Optional)
1. Run the SQL in `sql/message-notification-trigger-simple.sql` in Supabase
2. Send a message and verify the trigger creates notification records

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Send a text message ‚Üí Check console logs
- [ ] Send a photo message ‚Üí Check console logs  
- [ ] Send a voice message ‚Üí Check console logs
- [ ] Check `notification_history` table for new records
- [ ] Verify push notifications appear on recipient device
- [ ] Test with notifications disabled in preferences

## Console Logs to Look For

When sending messages, you should see:
```
üì§ Sending real-time message: { conversationId: "...", content: "...", messageType: "text" }
‚úÖ Message sent successfully: [message-id]
‚úÖ Push notification sent successfully
```

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications Still Not Working?

1. **Check Console Logs**
   - Look for error messages in the browser console
   - Verify the `sendMessageNotification` method is being called

2. **Check Database**
   - Verify `notification_preferences` table exists and has user records
   - Check if `notification_history` table exists
   - Ensure user has `message_notifications: true` and `push_enabled: true`

3. **Check Push Tokens**
   - Verify `push_tokens` table has valid tokens for the recipient
   - Check if tokens are marked as `is_active: true`

4. **Check Edge Function**
   - Verify the `send-push-notification` edge function is deployed
   - Check Supabase function logs for errors

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Tables**: Run `sql/notifications-setup.sql` first
2. **Permission Errors**: Check RLS policies on notification tables
3. **Environment Variables**: Ensure `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set
4. **Push Token Issues**: Verify push tokens are properly stored and active

## Files Modified

- ‚úÖ `src/services/realtimeChat.ts` - Added automatic notification sending
- üìù `sql/message-notification-trigger-simple.sql` - Database trigger (optional)
- üìù `README/README-MESSAGE-NOTIFICATIONS-FIX.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps

After confirming notifications work:

1. **Monitor Performance**: Watch for any performance impact from notification sending
2. **Add Error Handling**: Implement retry logic for failed notifications
3. **Add Analytics**: Track notification delivery and open rates
4. **Extend to Other Events**: Add similar notification logic for matches, likes, etc.

## Quick Fix Summary

The main issue was that notifications weren't being sent automatically when messages were created. I've implemented a client-side solution that:

1. **Automatically sends notifications** when `sendMessage()` is called
2. **Creates notification records** in the database
3. **Calls the push notification service** for immediate delivery
4. **Handles all message types** (text, photo, voice, GIF, sticker)
5. **Respects user preferences** for notifications

This should fix your notification issue immediately without requiring database changes.
