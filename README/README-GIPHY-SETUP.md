# Giphy API Setup Guide

## üîß Fixing the "Giphy API key not available" Error

The error you're seeing occurs because the Giphy API key is not properly configured. Here's how to fix it:

### **‚úÖ Recommended Solution: Environment Variables**

This is the **easiest and most reliable** approach:

1. **Create Environment File**:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

2. **Get a Free Giphy API Key**:
   - Visit [https://developers.giphy.com/](https://developers.giphy.com/)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Create an app and get your API key

3. **Add Your API Key**:
   ```bash
   # Edit .env file and replace with your actual API key
   EXPO_PUBLIC_GIPHY_API_KEY=your_actual_giphy_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Restart your app**

### **‚ùå Why Supabase Vault Doesn't Work**

**Important**: Supabase Vault cannot be accessed directly from client-side code for security reasons. The errors you saw were because:

- ‚ùå **No direct access**: Vault secrets require server-side implementation
- ‚ùå **Security restriction**: Designed to prevent client-side access to sensitive data
- ‚ùå **Client limitations**: React Native/Expo apps run on the client side

### **‚úÖ Alternative: Use Sample GIFs (No Setup Required)**

If you don't want to set up a Giphy API key, the app will automatically fall back to sample GIFs:
- ‚úÖ **Works immediately** without any configuration
- ‚úÖ **All features functional** with sample content
- ‚úÖ **No API key needed**

## **Current Status**

‚úÖ **Error Fixed**: The service now gracefully handles missing API keys
‚úÖ **Fallback System**: Uses sample GIFs when API key is unavailable
‚úÖ **No More Crashes**: App continues to work without API key
‚úÖ **Better Error Handling**: Logs warnings instead of throwing errors

## **Testing**

After setting up the API key:

1. **Restart the app** to load the new environment variable
2. **Test emoji/GIF picker** in comments or replies
3. **Check console logs** for any remaining issues

## **Sample GIFs Available**

The app includes a collection of sample GIFs that work without any API key:
- Trending GIFs
- Search functionality (with sample results)
- Stickers
- Random GIFs

## **Next Steps**

1. **Use environment variables** (recommended approach)
2. **Get a Giphy API key** for full functionality
3. **Add it to your .env file**
4. **Restart the app**
5. **Enjoy full Giphy integration!**

The error should now be resolved and the emoji/GIF picker will work properly! üéâ
